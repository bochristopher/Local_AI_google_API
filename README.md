Local AI Google API Script
This Python script combines the Google Custom Search API with a local AI model to fetch search results for a given query and analyze the sentiment of the results using a pre-trained Hugging Face model.

Features
Google Search Integration:

Fetches search results for a specified query using the Google Custom Search API.
Extracts titles and snippets from the search results.
Sentiment Analysis:

Uses a pre-trained Hugging Face model (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) to analyze the sentiment of the search results.
Outputs the sentiment (POSITIVE or NEGATIVE) and confidence score for each result.
Customizable Query:

Allows you to specify a search query to analyze different topics.
Requirements
